0.6.0 (2014-12-01)
------------------
* Values are now read from kinematics.yaml correctly.
* Simplified the inputKinematicsYAML() code.
* Debug and octomap improvements in launch file templates
* Values are now read from kinematics.yaml correctly. Previously, keys such
  as "kinematics_solver" were not found.
* Added clear octomap service to move_group launch file template
* Added gdb debug helper that allows easier break point addition
* Add launch file for joystick control of MotionPlanningPlugin
* Joint limits comments
* Removed velocity scaling factor
* Added a new 'velocity_scaling_factor' parameter to evenly reduce max joint velocity for all joints. Added documentation.
* Simply renamed kin_model to robot_model for more proper naming convension
* Added new launch file for controll Rviz with joystick
* use relative instead of absolute names for topics (to allow for namespaces)
* Added planner specific parameters to ompl_planning.yaml emitter.
* Added space after every , in function calls
  Added either a space or a c-return before opening {
  Moved & next to the variable in the member function declarations
* Added planner specific parameters to ompl_planning.yaml emitter.
  Each parameter is set to current defaults. This is fragile, as defaults may change.
